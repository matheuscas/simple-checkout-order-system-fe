# simple-checkout-order-system-fe

This is the front-end of the Simple Checkout Order System.

This is a React app using Ionic UI components.

To run it locally, you need install the dependencies with `npm install` and 
after that run `ionic serve`. 

Just to be perfectly clear, despite using Ionic cli and its components,
this is a regular React app that uses custom components.
